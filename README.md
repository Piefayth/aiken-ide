# aiken ide

react + redux toolkit

redux wont seem like overkill once we have wallet management and transaction building integrated
trust


todo:
    - aiken modules support (.ak files are totally independent atm)
    - file formatting for json
    - workspace sharing (how to safely handle app managed wallets? emulator is ok but still dont like sharing seeds)
    - compile on a worker thread
    - an unimaginably long list of other stuff
