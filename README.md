# aiken ide

idea: stop using deno or the cli to run your scripts. use a websight instead
stack: react + redux toolkit

todo:
- aiken modules support (.ak files are totally independent atm)

- file formatting for json

- workspace sharing

- compile on a worker thread

- non-emulator networks

- adjust panel sizes by clicking and dragging the divider between them

- selectable aiken version ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

- an unimaginably long list of other stuff
